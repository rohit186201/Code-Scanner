I undertook a project focused on real-time barcode decoding and authentication using computer vision techniques. Leveraging Python, OpenCV, and PyZBar, the project consists of two scripts: main.py and authentication.py.

main.py:
The script captures video frames from a camera, decodes barcodes using PyZBar, and visually presents the decoded information on the frames. This component serves as a fundamental barcode decoder.

authentication.py:
In this script, the focus shifts towards authentication. A predefined list of authorized data is read from a text file, and the script verifies the decoded barcode data against this list. The authentication status is displayed on the video frames, with different colors indicating authorized and unauthorized cases.

This project showcases my proficiency in computer vision, image processing, and coding skills, along with an understanding of real-world applications such as authentication systems. It serves as a testament to my ability to integrate various libraries and technologies to create practical solutions.
